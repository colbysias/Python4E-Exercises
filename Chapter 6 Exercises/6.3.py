#Exercise 3:
#
#Encapsulate this code in a function named count, and generalize it so that it accepts the string and the letter as arguments.
#word = 'banana'
#count = 0
#for letter in word:
#    if letter == 'a':
#        count = count + 1
#print(count)

def count(word, letter):
    count = 0
    for letter in word:
        if letter == 'a':
            count = count + 1
    return count

print(count('banana', 'a'))
